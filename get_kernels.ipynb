    "## Functions Description:\n",
    "The following functions constitute a set of operations related to connectivity analysis for coral reefs. These functions are designed to process data from shapefiles, distance matrices, and angle matrices to calculate various connectivity parameters. They provide essential functionalities such as selecting source and sink locations, ordering data based on a shapefile, calculating connectivity by sectors, and identifying top sectors with the highest connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestion for Optimization (to-do):\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the complexity and number of functions involved in connectivity analysis, it is recommended to save these functions in a separate file or library for optimization and reusability. By doing so, other scripts or projects can easily import and utilize these functions without duplicating code. Organizing these functions in a separate module will also enhance code maintenance and allow for future updates and improvements. Additionally, by centralizing these functions in a dedicated library, it becomes possible to streamline the process of making enhancements, bug fixes, and performance optimizations.\n"

    "#### Step 3: Main loop over the connectivity files\n",
    "The main loop over the connectivity files is the core process that iterates through all the connectivity matrices. This main loop is divided into several substeps, each representing important stages of the overall source code execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4: Open Output File for Writing Kernel Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this step, an output file is created to store the calculated kernel parameters for each sink area.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 5: Iterate Over Sink Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "    During this step, the analysis iterates over each sink area, representing the regions that receive recruitment from neighboring sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 6: Select Source Locations Based on Connectivity, Angle, and Distance Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here, the source locations that contribute to the recruitment in the current sink area are selected based on their connectivity, angle, and distance values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 7: Remove Outliers from the Selected Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "    This step involves filtering out any outlier source locations with extreme recruitment values, to ensure removing the tails of the distribution from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 8: Count Sectors Based on Filtered Angle Values\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sectors are determined by categorizing the filtered source locations into 10-degree bandwidths based on their angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 9: Calculate Total Connectivity, Bandwidth, Average Distance, and Weighted Distance by Sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "    During this step, various statistics, such as total connectivity, bandwidth, average distance, and weighted distance, are calculated for each sector. this step is crucial to understand the relative contribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 10: Check if Total Connectivity Is Zero, Write 'NaN' Values, and Continue to the Next Sink Area\n",
    "\n",
    "    A check is performed to ensure that the calculated connectivity is not zero. If it is, 'NaN' values are written to the output file for that sink area, and the analysis proceeds to the next sink area.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 11: Select Top Sectors Based on Total Connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "    The sectors with the highest total connectivity are selected as the top sectors to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 12: Calculate Proportion of Recruitment and Add Additional Sectors if Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this step, the proportion of recruitment contributed by the top sectors is calculated. If needed, additional sectors are added to ensure a recruitment proportion of at least 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 12.5: Cleaning the Vector with Zeros\n",
    "\n",
    "    Any zero elements in the resulting vector are removed for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 13: Find Two Groups Based on Bandwidth of Selected Sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "    The selected top sectors are divided into two groups based on their bandwidth, forming distinct clusters. This searching algorithm saves a lot of time when the calculation is done a *posteriori*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 14: Find Positions in the Bandwidth Matrix for Sector 1 and Sector 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    The positions of the two groups (sector 1 and sector 2) in the bandwidth matrix are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 15: Write Parameters for Sector 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    Kernel parameters, such as connectivity, angles, distance, and proportions, are written to the output file for sector 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 16: Write Parameters for Sector 2 if it Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "    If sector 2 exists, its kernel parameters are written to the output file as well.\n",
